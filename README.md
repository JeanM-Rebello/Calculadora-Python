# Calculator in Python
A project aimed at applying Object-oriented knowledge in Python along with basic notions of Python such as syntax, indentation, among others.

This project will continue to be expanded as my knowledge of Python increases and I want to increase the complexity of the calculator and simplify the code with my new knowledge.
